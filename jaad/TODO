AAC decoder
===========
- some frames throw IOException (EOF) -> perhaps Huffman decoding not correct
- SBR in ADTS stream has problems with sample frequency

MP4 boxes
=========
- implement IPMP descriptors
- mp3 also uses 'mp4a' (probably all kinds of MPEG audio) -> how to identify?
- boxes to implement:
	rash, mpod, wide, m4ds, btrt, avcp, avss, avll, sdep
	alac (apple lossless), 
	albm (album title & track number (user-data)),
	auth (media author name (user-data)),
	buff (buffering information),
	ccid (OMA DRM Content ID),
	cdef (type and ordering of the components within the codestream),
	clsf (Media classification (user-data)),
- implement more codecs boxes: e.g. ac3
- why are the ObjectDescriptor tags different in 14496-1 8.3.12 (table 8-12)?
- change samplegroup structures to the one used for sampleentries
- SLConfigDescriptor decodes wrong

MP4 API
=======
- movie/track fragments & extends
- implement rating
- how to use sample grouping?
- how to use sync samples & shadow sync samples?
- what is 'sample degradation priority'?
- what is 'track selection'?
- add itunes tags for 'account' and 'account type'
- use more tags from ID3
